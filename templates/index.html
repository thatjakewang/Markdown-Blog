    <h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a Financial & Data Analyst at a Japanese multinational parking operations firm, currently pursuing a part-time Master’s degree in Data Science. I am driven by uncovering business value behind data and building Python-based automation and predictive models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Operating within a rigorous cross-cultural business environment, my work focuses on operational and financial performance. I integrate data from multiple sources to streamline reporting workflows and deliver high-precision insights directly to executive leadership and the board. I enjoy bridging business needs with scalable analytics processes—from data preparation to dashboards and forecasting—to clarify revenue, costs, and key drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m continuously sharpening my skills in data engineering and statistical modeling, and I’m excited about applying them to solve real-world business problems.
